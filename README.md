# Live_news_portal_using_Ajax
# You can see latest news by refreshing the page 
By using news API key in Ajax
#In this mini project i was using news API key from "https://newsapi.org" here i create my own api key and add that key into my js code to fetch the news from a perticular news portal like TOI and BBC news.
#I used ajax and "get method" to get request from url and add those news in my "bootstrap collapse"
